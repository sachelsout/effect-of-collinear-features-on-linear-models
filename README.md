# effect-of-collinear-features-on-linear-models
This repository shows, how linear models behave if the features of the dataset are collinear in nature. Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Logistic Regression(LR) algorithms are used as linear models. Weights and accuracy scores are recorded in different scenarios.
